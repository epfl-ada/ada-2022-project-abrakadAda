# Wikispeedia : A glimpse of the human brain

## Abstract

With the help of the dataset wikispeedia we will study the behavior of humans playing the game : 
 - motivation : human behavior through wikispeedia
 - story : what influe the choices of the player
 - because we think that this game gives a lot of information about the functionment of the human brain.
 - ==>GLIMPSE OF THE HUMAN BRAIN
 
## Research questions 

3 different research dimension : 
- Spatial analysis
- Behavioral analysis
- Temporal analysis
 
That we will try to verify with a comparison with the optimal paths (machine behavior)

## Proposed additional dataset

## Methods (chacun Ã©crit ce qu'on fait)
- data analysis with python librairies : Pandas, Numpy, BeautifulSoup
- dataviz with Seaborn, Matplotlib

- For comportemantal analysis:
	- First, an analysis on how losing and winning influences the number of game played, using the number of games winned, lost and played to do linear regression and find the creteria that makes people want to play.
	- Secondly, the same analysis but using time spend while playing.
	- Then, an anaysis on the learning behavior of people through playing the game. I.e. if people get better the more they play the game. Need to do compaee win-rate, time spend per game, difficulty ratings... through time for each player.


## Proposed timeline
### Week 10
### Week 11
### Week 12
### Week 13
### Week 14

## Organization within the team
Christophe : Spatial data analysis, statistics and visualization <br/>
Emilien : Temporal analysis <br/>
Antoine : Behavior analysis <br/>
Teva : comparison with machine behavior <br/>

## Questions for TAs 
- We would like to incorporate machine learning into the project but we don't have ideas, where could we add some ?

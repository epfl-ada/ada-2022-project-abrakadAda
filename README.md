# Wikispeedia : A glimpse of the human brain

Teva Brotherson : <br/>
Emilien Seiler : <br/>
Christophe Roger : <br/>
Antoine Vincent  : <br/>

## Abstract

With the help of the dataset wikispeedia we will study the behavior of humans playing the game : 
 - motivation : human behavior through wikispeedia
 - story : what influe the choices of the player
 - because we think that this game gives a lot of information about the functionment of the human brain.
 - ==>GLIMPSE OF THE HUMAN BRAIN
 
## Research questions 

3 different research dimension : 
- Spatial analysis
- Behavioral analysis
- Temporal analysis
 
That we will try to verify with a comparison with the optimal paths (machine behavior)

## Proposed additional dataset

## Methods (chacun Ã©crit ce qu'on fait)
- data analysis with python librairies : Pandas, Numpy, BeautifulSoup
- dataviz with Seaborn, Matplotlib
- 


## Proposed timeline
### Week 10
### Week 11
### Week 12
### Week 13
### Week 14

## Organization within the team
Christophe : Spatial data analysis, statistics and visualization <br/>
Emilien : Temporal analysis <br/>
Antoine : Behavior analysis <br/>
Teva : comparison with machine behavior <br/>

## Questions for TAs 
- We would like to incorporate machine learning into the project but we don't have ideas, where could we add some ?
